<h3>
BIGFOOT JOE
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In a town of the north there dwelt three
men apart from their fellows.  One of these
men was a Philosopher, one was a Poet, and
one was a Painter.  These lived and wrought,
while all the folk looked up to them from afar
off.  There was a halfbreed called Bigfoot Joe
who hewed in a lumber camp, so that the folk
knew nothing of him.
</p>

<p>
The Philosopher penned a mystical work
on the philosophy of the woods, and he grew
known in the world.  The Poet wrote stanzas
filled with the music of the pines and cedars,
and his verse brought high wage.  The Painter
limned a single hemlock, instinct with the
breath of the lonely forest; and it found fame.
But, deep in the woods, trees crashed down
and the unknown lumberjack lopped off their
branches.
</p>

<p>
Now it so happened that a certain Great
Author, having heard of the famous Three,
journeyed across the seas to visit them; for he
was an unwearied seeker after the truth that
is in life.
</p>

<p>
The Artists, receiving him as a brother,
expounded to him the philosophy and rhythm
and tonal harmony of Nature; but the Great
Author warmed himself in their steam-heated
studios and said little.
</p>

<p>
One day the Artists took the distinguished
guest on a visit to the woods.  They came
to camp in time to lunch with the jacks, and
the visitor was seated next Bigfoot Joe.
Naturally observant, he noted that the halfbreed,
coming from the woods bare-headed, flung an
expressive glance at the thick furs of the
Philosopher.
</p>

<p>
During their meal the Painter apologized
for the coarse fare&mdash;the beans and bread,
the creamless coffee; but the halfbreed gorged
hugely, and drank his molasses-sweet coffee
with gusto.  The Poet was disgusted by the
table manners of the jacks, for a bread-fight
arose amid jests and curses; but the halfbreed
deftly caught a crust and devoured it.
</p>

<p>
Later, the visitors went to the woods and
watched the work.  Presently they came to
Bigfoot Joe; the others would have passed on
but the Great Author paused and spoke.
</p>

<p>
"B'jou," replied the halfbreed, wiping his
brow and staring at the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"Is the work hard?"
</p>

<p>
"It is my work&mdash;I am strong, me!  You
little man, wear four eyes."  His gaze swept
in contempt over the visitor.  "Dis tree, she's
be my brudder; she's be tall, strong like me.
'Bon!' she's say.  'You good lumberjack, you
Joe!'"  And his axe bit a deep chord of assent
from the heart of the pine.
</p>

<p>
The Great Author perceived that here was
a philosopher, who drew from the woods his
one rule: "Work!  You are here; so it is
evident that you were to be a lumberjack&mdash;but
be careful to be a <i>good</i> lumberjack!"
</p>

<p>
The halfbreed was a poet, for he could
read the secret heart of the woods and make
response from his own.  He was a painter,
whose brush was the axe; with that brush he
limned great canvases, whose truth all
woodsmen loved instantly.
</p>

<p>
The Philosopher groped after his soul, the
Painter strove to express his soul, and the Poet
tried to clothe his soul in words.  The
half-breed, caring nothing about soul, struck fire
from the spirit of the Great Author, who knew
what a plain thing the soul really is; this, in
fact, was why he was a Great Author.
</p>

<p>
And so, when he had returned again to
his own country, the Great Author neglected
to write about the famous Artists.  Instead,
he penned a wonderful tale about a halfbreed
Indian, and the world cried out in rapture.
</p>

<p>
But the three Artists bitterly termed him
an ignorant fakir.

<h3>
THE CLEAR WORD
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There has been a good deal of mysticism
in the public prints lately&mdash;emanations from
Point Loma, perhaps; subtle propaganda.
</p>

<p>
They are interesting, these men with the
wide eyes.  They write about a multitude of
things; they are masters of glowing phrases,
golden wordings, witchery of thought.
</p>

<p>
Eternally invincible are they, being very
nebulous and vague.  So lofty are their ideals
and visions that never by any chance can they
be brought down to concrete wordings.  Fixed
in the abstract, they leave to their readers the
interpretation of these sacred thought-gems.
</p>

<p>
Fine fluidity rounds the paragraphs, and
a wizardry of poeticism gilds the pages, until
any central idea is lost in dazzled wonder at
the pyrotechnics.  The type of writing is intoxicating
but not tonic.  It is impressionistic and
owns a very vague sense of philology; "vers
libre" is a case in point.  Art or music may
legally convey impressions, but the business
of words is to convey thought; each word in
the language is an historical entity.  When
words are so cleverly conjoined as to present
only an impression, something is amiss.
</p>

<p>
Our mystics have some central thought,
spread it across scores of pages, and lose it;
they are style et praeterea nihil.  They won't
play to the gallery, preferring the circle.  As
a matter of fact, they have no hope of ever
reaching the gallery.
</p>

<p>
It is the great mass of our fiction magazines
that reflect the gallery, the vox populi.
Magazinedom is aligned in favor of the story
related with an artful simplicity&mdash;the clear
word!
</p>

<p>
The clear word; that is the thing!  The
forthright, honest word, signifying something
foursquare and definite!  When Snorri quilled
that great chronicle, the Heimskringla, his
words fitted like a mosaic; he left us a perfect
example of the clear word.
</p>

<p>
A work of literature creates a character,
then evolves it through the stress of exterior
circumstances.  The magazine story takes its
character ready-made, evolving a plot through
the stress of that character upon exterior
circumstances.  If we regard this as cheapening
of a noble art, and decidedly infra dig., then
recollect how our grandsires applied like terms
to Dumas and other masters.
</p>

<p>
The past twenty years have here evolved
a type of magazine that serenely ignores the
ranting of the Elder Brethren.  It has created
a writer as peculiar to this country as is the
feuilletoniste to France.  These magazines of
fiction have filled a gap; and they have been
eagerly acclaimed by the reading public.
</p>

<p>
This reading public, not being confined to
the New England states but being comprised
largely of hoi polloi, does not want character
studies.  It wants a well-ordered, wholly false
and often absurd plot-scheme, progressing in
a straight line instead of by zigzag dashes, as
in life; but it demands that this plot-scheme
be plausible, intricate and fascinating.
</p>

<p>
A new fiction magazine makes its curtsey
by deploring these facts and apologetically
devotes its pages only to the highest forms of
writing.  Stuff!  Why cringe to the Elder
Brethren?  An editor interprets the wishes of the
public; he is not to suit his own whims, but
to make money for the owners.
</p>

<p>
The public knows what it wants, and will
pay to get it.  The mystics may become the
oracles of new cults, may set about remaking
their own petty worlds after their hearts'
desires; but they cannot make a living by the
quill.  Even the music critics have come from
their misty pinnacles.
</p>

<p>
Simplicity has cash value.  That is why
the magazines pay such excellent prices for
the clear word&mdash;which is the hardest of
all to write.

<h3>
THE NAKED MAN
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A section of the Argonne wood is feebly
lighted by distant star shells.  Over the
mechanical and human wreckage eddies the vapor
of poison gas; yet the two men sitting against
the ruined gun-emplacement wear no masks,
and seem not to feel the gas.  One is a husky
chap, a marine; his left foot, gone above the
ankle, is replaced by an ineffectual tourniquet.
The other is a conscript; across his breast is
a wide gash of bubbling red.
</p>

<p>
Nearby lies a German, bayonet-gashed,
who from time to time opens his eyes.  At his
knee lies an empty U.S.A. canteen.
</p>

<p>
The Marine: You were a damn' fool to
give him that bottle!  Not that it matters to
us, only&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Conscript, smiling: You gave him
yours first!
</p>

<p>
The Marine: Sure; I figured yours 'ud do
us, but we should worry now!  Say, Fritzie
learned somethin' about fightin' today, huh?
</p>

<p>
The Conscript: I feel like writing a poem
about it; only I'll never write it, of course&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Marine: Cut the comedy, bo!  Say,
the way you knifed this guy was one swell bit
o' work!  After he ploughed you up, too!
</p>

<p>
The poet-conscript shivers.  The German
opens his eyes wide and looks at them.
</p>

<p>
The German: Listen&mdash;the music!  Can
you hear it?  The Brunhilde motif; it is the
valkyr coming for me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
His eyes close again, his head droops.
</p>

<p>
The Marine: Plumb nuts; I bet he ain't
et a square meal in a year!  Say, what d'you
figure on seein' next, bo?
</p>

<p>
The Conscript, blankly: Eh?
</p>

<p>
The Marine: Why, we don't swallow no
bull about fightin' for democracy and goin' to
heaven; everybody except the home folks is
wise to that bunk.  But where do we land on
the other side, hey?  Fightin' Heinie won't
ticket us to the pearly gates, will it?
</p>

<p>
The Conscript, gazing at the curling trees
in the mist: Search me!  Religion never
bothered me much; and just now I'm sorry.
</p>

<p>
The Marine: Sorry, hell!  Cut out the
regrets.  If you hadn't give that guy your
canteen we might ha' lasted till morning.
</p>

<p>
The Conscript: If you hadn't crawled to
help prop him up, your tourniquet might not
have given way&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Suddenly startled, both men turn their
heads.  Before them appears the figure of a
man, nearly naked, an open wound in his
side; he is regarding them attentively.
</p>

<p>
The Marine: Hullo!  Where in hell did
you come from&mdash;front lines?  Sit down and
take it easy; no Croy Rouge nor nothin' here
to hurry you.  Got it bad?
</p>

<p>
The Conscript: Here's an extra first-aid
packet&mdash;better stop the bleeding.
</p>

<p>
The naked man moves closer, but refuses
the proffered packet.
</p>

<p>
The Naked Man: Thank you, brother,
but it would do me no good.
</p>

<p>
The Marine: I guess you're right there.
Bayonet, hey?  Jabbed up an' got you.
</p>

<p>
The Naked Man: I've come from inside
the German lines.
</p>

<p>
The Conscript: Captured and got away,
eh?  Stripped off your uniform&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Marine: What's your division?  I bet
Liggett's corp's been catchin' hell!
</p>

<p>
The Naked Man: I am unattached.
</p>

<p>
The Marine, feebly tossing out his mask:
Take this; it can't help me, but there's gas
around.
</p>

<p>
The Naked Man: Thanks, brother, but
I hardly think it would help me, either.
</p>

<p>
The naked man moves, to show them his
wounded feet.  He opens his hands; and the
conscript breaks into a bitter cry.
</p>

<p>
The Conscript: By God!  Crucified you,
like they did to the Canucks!
</p>

<p>
The Marine, pityingly: Aw, hell!
</p>

<p>
The German soldier opens his eyes,
staring about in vacant wonder.
</p>

<p>
The German: To whom are you talking?
There is no one here.  Ach, the Valkyr song!
It is drawing nearer&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The naked man throws him a glance of
stern pity.  Then he turns and extends his
hand to the conscript.
</p>

<p>
The Naked Man: Come!  I'll help you&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Conscript, smiling: No use, pard!
You chase along&mdash;we're here for keeps.
</p>

<p>
The Naked Man: Take my hand and get
up!  I've come to take you home.
</p>

<p>
The Marine, laughing harshly: Home!
</p>

<p>
With a faint shrug, the conscript touches
the extended hand, grips it, and rises.  In
his face dawns amazed incredulity.
</p>

<p>
The Conscript: Good lord!  I believe I
can walk after all!
</p>

<p>
The naked man turns and holds out his
hand to the marine in silent command.
</p>

<p>
The Marine, roughly: Aw, don't be a
fool&mdash;can't you see I only got one foot?
You guys chase along&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Naked Man: I tell you, come!  Put
an arm around my neck; we'll do very well.
Take my hand and get up!
</p>

<p>
Compelled, the marine obeys.  Into his
bronzed face leaps surprise as he rises.  After
getting one arm about his helper's neck, he
pauses suddenly.
</p>

<p>
The Marine: Look here, you ain't in no
shape to stand us both&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Naked Man: Be quiet, brother!  We
are going home, and you need not doubt my
strength.  Come, let us go.
</p>

<p>
They start away, the marine moving by
awkward hops, but moving.  The conscript
holds to the arm of the naked man, throwing
him sidelong glances of frightened
surmise&mdash;and at length checks himself abruptly.
</p>

<p>
The Conscript: I don't know if I'm out
of my head&mdash;no, no!  It's an impossibility.
I'm afraid even to think of it&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The naked man smiles.  Behind them the
German once more opens his eyes and looks
about in wonder.
</p>

<p>
The German: Where are they gone?  No
one is here&mdash;they were talking, yet I see no
one.  I can see no one!
</p>

<p>
The naked man casts over his shoulder a
look of ineffable sorrow.  From him comes a
murmur.
</p>

<p>
The Naked Man: No, you can see no
one.  You cannot even see ME!  And that,
as you shall come to know, is hell.

<h3>
ONE NIGHT AT HEALY'S
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We recall many a charming tale, done
in the most Lamb-like of accents, regarding
the rare and curious old volumes picked up at
the farthing stalls.  Le Gallienne has
reminisced most delightfully and incredibly in this
fashion, as have others; but I, for one, long
ago decided that these degenerate days never
witnessed such discoveries as those recorded
in le temps jadis.
</p>

<p>
Many and many an hour have I spent
delving along dusty shelves in grimy shops,
or by the less alluring ways of the spick-and-span,
rebound and furbished, dustless and
listed Olde Book Shoppe whose displays are
priced at their weight in carets.  In both have
I been disappointed.  Many a catalog have I
pored over, only to decide that all catalogs
are supplied from publishers' remainders.
</p>

<p>
One concludes that the old book trade
is a thing of the past, at least so far as we
none too affluent consumers are concerned.
The dealers know too much about their wares
and are too eager after excess profits.  They
fatten upon the rich manufacturer who seeks
scholarly polish, or the scholar who has
inherited the price of gratification.  If they find
an Elzevir, however mean, they placard it at
a rare price, and await the victim who thinks
that all Elzevirs are treasures.
</p>

<p>
Once, indeed, I found a little shop in
New Orleans, off the tourist lanes, where I
encountered over a score of delightful volumes
in French, filled with hand-tinted plates, at
some very low figure.  Alas!  I had just been
entrapped in Royal street and had but little
money left.  I bought a number of the sweet
tooled-morocco volumes at some little
sacrifice, and went my way.  Later, in funds, I
returned for the remainder of the set, only to
find that a famous playwright had discovered
the treasure&mdash;and all were vanished.
</p>

<p>
With this exception, luck was seldom
mine.  Old book shops were many, bargains
few.  From city to city it was the same old
story; until, upon a cold and foggy night in
San Francisco, I chanced to pass the
forbidding and grimy portal of a shop kept by one
Healy.
</p>

<p>
I merely sniffed and turned to catch a
jitney; I had come from a survey of certain
downtown shops and felt that I had no more
time to waste.  Then I saw the proprietor,
sitting in an easy-chair in his window, which
framed dull old spectacles within a luxuriant
and mighty fringe of reddish-grey whiskers.
Fascinated, I turned again.  Once more to
try my luck!  Hopeless though I knew it to
be, I would still essay the impossible&mdash;and
I entered.
</p>

<p>
Truth to tell, my entry was compelled
less by hope than by that curious spectacle
in the window.  In the doorway I came to a
pause, aghast before a dim array of shelves
which at some prior day had been assorted,
but were now jumbled and heaped in a most
erratic madness of confusion.
</p>

<p>
The fringed old gentleman in the easy
chair was reading one of his own books; and
this was an excellent sign.  He barely
vouchsafed a grunt to my greeting, directed me to
switch on the lamps and help myself, then
resumed his book and a huge pipe.
</p>

<p>
As directed, I turned on the lights and
began my explorations.  Already the mystic
alchemy of this stage-setting held me gripped
in a pleasant excitation, a glowing confidence
that here awaited unguessed treasure-trove!
</p>

<p>
Mirabile dictu!  At the very first turn
I pulled down a glorious big volume, newly
bound in half morocco, which proved to be
no other than Dr. Shaw's Travels in Barbary.
</p>

<p>
Every map, every letter and engraving
and page was perfect, even the paper was as
chastely unblemished as when struck off the
press of Oxford University in the days of the
first George.  The press-work, like that of
the first folio of Beaumont &amp; Fletcher, was
a delight to the eye; abounding in Arabic,
old-style Greek, Hebrew and less-remembered
tongues, it was all as nobly executed as if it
had been drawn by hand and lithographed.
</p>

<p>
A price was penciled on the flyleaf; it
would scarcely have amounted to taxicab fare
home.  I sighed over the high insolence that
prompts dealers to face their customers with
the prices these wares fetched twenty or fifty
years ago; then I turned to the fringed
divinity with tremulous query.
</p>

<p>
"Everything marked plain," he made
response, without raising his eyes from the
book in his lap.
</p>

<p>
Ye gods and little bookworms&mdash;the
dream had come true!  Or was it a chance
find&mdash;perhaps some lure to catch unwary
feet?
</p>

<p>
No matter; within five minutes dinner
was forgotten, all responsibilities put aside,
and I was hooked fast.  Those unordered
shelves held everything from Russian novels
to French scientific treatises, and Americana
ran riot.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a copy of Vetelius, that rare
edition of saga-chants, for fifty cents; and,
no less expensive, a spanking fine copy of
Mme. de Grandfort's execrated work on the
Louisiana Creoles, serene in its dingy binding
of ante-bellum days!  Here was the sort of
place hitherto found only in romancers' tales!
</p>

<p>
And a little old French handbook for
gardeners, with quaintly tinted plates; or a
first edition of Palgrave, or a historical work
from the library of the Garde Royale Hussars!
</p>

<p>
Then the discovery of Ripperda's
memoirs&mdash;Ripperda, that fine Hollander who
became a Spaniard, wearing the collar of the
Golden Fleece and ruling all the wide realms
of Spain, then passed into Morocco and ruled
that land as pasha&mdash;Ripperda, who took
new religions or families at will, but ruled
always until the gout fetched him to a devout
Christian end&mdash;here was the crowning find!
</p>

<p>
I staggered home that night freighted
with treasure.  A few days later I returned,
with the intent of further March and seizure;
but this time I did not enter.  I only turned
mournfully from the doorway, above which
flaunted the dire announcement:
</p>

<p class="t3">
THIS PLACE HAS CHANGED HANDS
</p>

<h3>
THE LITTLE VISITORS
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[1] This final title has been altered since the printing
of the Table of Contents.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was lately my good fortune&mdash;and
I so term it advisedly&mdash;to entertain a
budding Bolshevist in my midst.
</p>

<p>
He was an excellent young man and a
fellow writer, who had been discharged as
an officer of the nation's armed forces.  Not
knowing him intimately, I invited him, with
his brother, to spend a part of the summer
in a cottage which I maintained as an office.
</p>

<p>
In due time the twain arrived and were
heartily welcomed.  They were made quite at
home in my studio, which was furnished to
my own fancy with books, rugs, tools of the
trade, rare and curious objects from foreign
parts, and, what occasioned much interest,
an amount of correspondence filed away.
</p>

<p>
The young gentlemen made themselves
very much at home, and, in the course of a
few days' intimacy, confessed to a boyishly
intense sympathy with the Bolsheviki.  They
reveled in a white-collar abstinence, oblivious
that the hated uniforms were vastly more
becoming than their present garb, and took a
keen delight in tearing to shreds the integrity
of the press and the administration.  One
must admit that the latter was rather silly;
but to think the press of the world in a vast
conspiracy of lies against Lenine et al.,
savored too much of a de Quincy phantasy.
</p>

<p>
Political creeds, of course, could not
mar the pleasure of the visit.  But in course
of time it gradually dawned upon me that
my guests were rather exacting in their way
of taking things for granted.
</p>

<p>
They acquired a happy faculty of letting
me run their errands, or of utilizing my
services as chauffeur.  The only argument
against this was its matter-of-course air.  I
presume that the Bolsheviki, like the Arabs,
feel any expression of gratitude to be
unworthy them.
</p>

<p>
Still, this was but a small cavil against
great writers&mdash;men of genius who had
accomplished high things in their profession and
were attaining a worthy place in literature!
</p>

<p>
It was with some misgivings, however,
that I observed certain very odd tendencies;
such as, for example, plying the gentle arts
of Munchausen upon the despised caste of
editors.
</p>

<p>
When one delicately hinted that this
might hardly be considered as strictly ethical,
the notion was greeted with roars of scornful
laughter.  Ethics were individual things
entirely, much beneath the consideration of
free artists.  And what was an editor
compared with one who wrote literature?  Less
than the dust!
</p>

<p>
However, the suggestion that it was
the editor who wrote the checks, proved to
be sobering&mdash;amazingly sobering.
</p>

<p>
The days wore breezily on, with much
writing and earnest endeavor, and much
discussion of why no man in the writing game
today deserved the place he held; that is, no
man at the top.  One or two had some facility;
a little plot, perhaps, a gift of words, a
lilt to paragraphs&mdash;but this was "all they
had."  The heroic dead, happily, possessed
virtues.
</p>

<p>
There began to be a Bolshevik atmosphere
about the place, a vague and
unsatisfied air of much begun and little finished.
Oddly enough, my friend were working on
anti-red propaganda; excellent work, too, if
it did come but slowly.  Curious how antipathy
to white collars seems to involve in its
anathema all forms of hard labor!
</p>

<p>
The visitors found the country lonely.
One evening I dropped in unexpectedly at the
office, and my presence seemed to excite an
odd embarrassment.  It developed that my
friends were giving a party, so of course I at
once withdrew gracefully.
</p>

<p>
Some time later, a young man about
town informed me, grinningly, that them
letters I got from editors were suttinly rich!
Upon inquiry I found that my guests kindly
elucidated the art of writing, to their local
acquaintance, by means of my correspondence.
</p>

<p>
Nor did they deny the matter.  They
were so puzzled at my objections that anger
could not exist; since I did object, of course
it would occur no more.  In the face of so
charming a simplicity, what could the
ruffled course of hospitality do but resume the
even tenor of its way?
</p>

<p>
But little things, as is their habit, in
time grow onerous.  Around the books, the
rare and curious objects, the writing tools,
climbed filth and squalor unbelievable.  In
despair, seeking the kindliest way out of the
impasse, I was summoned away for a month
or so.  Not without some misgivings&mdash;quite
justified by events.
</p>

<p>
When I returned to the office, I found
that my guests had departed.  So had many
of my books and things.  In their stead
remained castoff raiment and much misplaced
matter.
</p>

<p>
I have now adopted the firm rule of invariably
inquiring into the politics of a friend
before erecting him into the status of a guest.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
